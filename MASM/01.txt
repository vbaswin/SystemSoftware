bx and cx   => are 16 bit registers

int 21h     => dos intere

mov ah,<no>

01h         -> input            -> al
09h         -> diplay string    -> from dx
02h         -> output char      -> from dl(stored as ascii form)
4ch         -> exit             -> status of termination stored in al

aaa         ->
    (always clear ah before aaa)
    lower nibble of al < 9  -> clear higher nibble of al, inc ah
    lower nibble of al > 9  -> lower nibble + 6 > higher nibble in ah, lower nibble of al in al

except storing strings all the other function calls use 8-bit register

0ah     -> feed input
0dh     -> carriage return
(both commands are executed in common to move to the beginning of next line)

illegal size of operand mostly means using 8 bit registers where 16 bit is required here
for pop

div in masm we need to clear dx ig
